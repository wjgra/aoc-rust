## Advent of Code in Rust
These are my solutions to AoC 2024, which I used as an excuse to try Rust. This was my first time using the language and so these are hardly exemplary programs, but it was good fun to try something different.

Since this is essentially a collection of answers to coding challenges, I see no need for a detailed description here. Moreover, the level of commenting is somewhat lower than usual - the focus was on a) solving the problems and b) having fun in the run up to Christmas.
