## Advent of Code in Rust
These are my ongoing solutions to AoC 2024, which I am using as an excuse to try Rust. This is my first time using the language and so these are hardly exemplary programs, but it has been good fun (at least so far...) to try something different.

Since this is essentially a collection of answers to coding challenges, I see no need for a detailed description here. Moreover, the level of commenting is somewhat lower than usual - the focus is on a) solving the problems and b) having fun in the run up to Christmas.
